# comp315Library
A Trivial Library Database in c++
This project was done from an Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms class (COMP315) while studying at Universidad Ana G. MÃ©ndez Gurabo Campus. The project consisted of making a library database consisting of various data structures all composed within each other. Authors are in singly linked list alphabeticlly sorted by last name. Books are in a doubly circular linked list alphabetically sorted by book title. Genres are in a binary search tree alphabetically sorted by genre title.
